	<p1>Here you will find most of my old screenplays along with their, I admit, pompous posters as well as my ongoing story, Wandering Soul. </p1>
	<br>
	<br>
	<p1>The first three are part of what I like to refer to as <em>The Relationship Trilogy</em> which explores friendship, romantic love and parenthood. Married to those themes are my interpretation of the philosophy of Nietzsche as well as ideas on psychoanalysis from Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung. As for the rest, I’ll leave that for you to uncover.
	<br>
	<br>
	Besides the trilogy, The Palace of Dr. Remarde is by far my most experimental script. I attempted to create a narrative puzzle that the reader must piece together to grasp the full story. As for Wandering Soul, it’s a passion project I’m undertaking with the goal of creating a massive sci-fi epic like no other.</p1>
	<br>
	<br>
	<p1>Each of these stories are very personal to me and I sincerely hope you’ll enjoy reading them just as much as I enjoyed writing them!  </p1>
