	<p1>Here you will find most of my old screenplays along with their, I admit, pompous posters as well as my ongoing story: Wandering Soul. </p1>
	<br>
	<br>
	<p1>The first three are part of what I like to refer to as <em>The Relationship Trilogy</em> which explores friendship, romantic love and parenthood. Married to those themes are some of my interpretations of the philosophy of Nietzsche, Hegel and Kant. I also incorporated some ideas on psychoanalysis from Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung as part of the narrative. As for the rest, I’ll leave that for you to uncover.
	<br>
	<br>
	Besides the trilogy, The Palace of Dr. Remarde is by far my most experimental script. I attempted to create a narrative puzzle that the reader must piece together to grasp the full story. As for Wandering Soul, it’s a passion project I’m undertaking with the goal of creating a massive sci-fi epic like no other.</p1>
	<br>
	<br>
	<p1>Each of these stories are very personal to me and I sincerely hope you’ll enjoy reading them just as much as I enjoyed writing them!  </p1>
